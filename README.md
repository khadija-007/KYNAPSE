# KYNAPSE
This contains all the files for the kynapse website i.e the index, style, form, about, services, thankyou and all the pictures.
each different webpage connecting to the original page has been written seperately
all the code has a single css file that handles all the presentation and layout.
the icon was created on my own and then added to the index.html
the form is fully functional and doesnt let the user proceed without entering the valid fields.
